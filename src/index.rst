You may also check out the various projects I contribute to:

*   `phpfarm`_

    My custom fork of `Christian Weiske`_'s phpfarm project.
    phpfarm allows you to run several versions of PHP alongside each other.

*   `Erebot`_

    A modular IRC bot written in PHP.

*   `Plop`_

    A user-friendly yet very flexible logging system for PHP applications
    (compatible with the :psr:`3` logging interface).

*   `XRL`_

    An easy-to-use XML-RPC library for PHP (both as a client and a server)
    with a syntax that feels very natural.

    It supports many common XML-RPC extensions and it handles type autoboxing.

*   `Pssht`_

    A PHP library for building SSH servers with support for various
    advanced features.
