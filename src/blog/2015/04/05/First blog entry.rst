First blog entry
================

This is the very first post for my new blog about IT-related stuff!

As I mostly develop using PHP & Python, most blog entries will be
about these programming languages.
I'll probably also discuss specific projects I'm working on:

*   `phpfarm`_

    My custom fork of `Christian Weiske`_'s phpfarm project.
    phpfarm allows you to run several versions of PHP alongside each other.

*   `Erebot`_

    A modular IRC bot written in PHP

*   ...and its sub-projects/sub-components:

    *   `Plop`_

        A user-friendly yet very flexible logging system for PHP applications
        (compatible with the :psr:`3` logging interface)

    *   `Erebot/URI`_

        A library made for parsing and generating
        Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)

    *   `Erebot/Timer`_

        A PHP library to run some code after a certain amount
        of time has passed

    *   `Erebot/CallableWrapper`_

        A special wrapper to emulate the "callable" typehint in PHP 5.3.x.

    *   `Erebot/DOM`_

        A PHP class that adds `Schematron`_ validation capabilities
        to the standard `DOM extension`_.

    *   `Erebot/Intl`_

        A library to handle internationalisation (i18n) of PHP applications
        using `gettext catalogs`_.

    *   `Erebot/Styling`_

        A library to create formatted IRC messages using HTML-like markup.
        It can handle complex i18n rules, lists and arrays, colors, etc.

*   `XRL`_

    An easy-to-use XML-RPC library for PHP (both as a client and a server)
    with a syntax that feels very natural.

    It supports many common XML-RPC extensions and it handles type autoboxing.

*   `Pssht`_

    A PHP library for building SSH servers with support for various
    advanced features:

    *   compression
    *   counter mode (ctr) ciphers
    *   SHA-2
    *   ECDH & ECDSA
    *   UMAC
    *   AEAD (eg. AES-GCM)
    *   Curve25519 & Ed25519
    *   ChaCha20-Poly1305
    *   ...

*   ...and probably others too :)
